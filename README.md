## Structure:
The “About” page introduces the topic and structure of the blog.
The “Background” page explains the technical aspect of LLMs.
In the “Posts”, four scenarios can be found, on how LLMs might influence democracy, what would be needed to do this and how negative consequences can be avoided.

Additionally one scenario (ModelRecruit) was written by ChatGPT, based on our own ideas as a prompt. This was done to experiment with GPT 3.5’s ability to write imaginative scenarios, use references and reason about political and societal processes.

The images for the scenarios and the profile picture of the blog were generated by DALL-E or the DALL-E powered Image Creator by Microsoft Bing. Humanoid robots were used to symbolize language models, although the models in the scenarios are not necessarily embodied.

All of our references can be found in the respective posts.
